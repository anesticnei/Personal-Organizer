# Personal-Organizer

Welcome to my personal organizer project! This website allows you to manage your daily tasks and routines in an easy and organized manner.

This website is divided into three tabs: Workout Week, Food Week, and To-Do List. Each tab is dedicated to a specific aspect of your daily routine, and you can create and manage items for each tab separately.

The Workout Week tab allows you to plan your workout routine for the week.

The Food Week tab is dedicated to planning your meals for the week.

The To-Do List tab allows you to create and manage your daily tasks and reminders. You can add items to your to-do list for each day, and edit or delete them as needed.

In addition to these features, the website includes a dark mode option, which is easy on the eyes and perfect for working at night. All of your data is saved in local storage, so you can close the website and come back later to find everything just as you left it.
